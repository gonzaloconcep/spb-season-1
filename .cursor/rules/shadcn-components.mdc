When installing or working with UI components:

1. Always use shadcn for new component installations
2. Installation commands must follow this format:
   ```bash
   npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
   ```

3. Component styling guidelines:
   - Use Tailwind classes for custom styling
   - Maintain the default shadcn theme tokens
   - Place custom variants in the components.json configuration

4. Component location:
   - All shadcn components should be installed in the components/ui directory
   - Custom components that use shadcn should be in app/components

5. Best practices:
   - Always check the shadcn documentation before customizing components
   - Keep the components.json file updated with any new modifications
   - Use the provided hooks and context providers from shadcn

Example usage:
```bash
# Installing a button component
npx shadcn@latest add button

# Installing a dialog component
npx shadcn@latest add dialog
```

Remember to:
- Review the installed component in components/ui/[component-name]
- Check for any required dependencies in the installation output
- Update theme configurations in tailwind.config.ts if needed
